# Multi-Domain Price Estimator

## Overview
The **Multi-Domain Price Estimator** is a Flask-based web application that predicts prices for various domains, including cars, laptops, houses, and mobile phones. It utilizes machine learning algorithms such as scikit-learn, train-test split, linear regression, and gradient descent.

## Features
1. **Domain-Specific Prediction**: Users can input relevant features (e.g., car model, laptop specifications, house details) to get accurate price estimates.
2. **User-Friendly Interface**: The web app provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the prediction model.
3. **Scalability**: The project can easily accommodate additional domains or features.
